# User Guide - getting to know the operation of your ESP32 S3 BOX 3
Here I will explain in breif what the different function of this firmware will give you.

## Physical buttons
The device has 3 physical buttons and 1 touch button. ( the red circle button ) 
The button on top of your device is a hardwired mute button and pressing it will stop the device responding to voice. You will know if this has been activated by the ilumination of an orange light to the left of the button.
If this is activate dyou need to press the button for the light to go off and then reboot the device. Avoid using this button as it is not required and there is a touch screen button for muting the mic and muting the speaker.

The top button on the left side of the device is currently configured to display the screen saver page on first press and a second press will return to the home page. (this can also be configured in the config file to act differently and is covered in the 'make it your own' guide.

The bottom button on the left hand side is to reboot the device and this can not be configured to act differently.

The red circle touch button can be configured to do as you wish and by default is configured to display the home screen.
